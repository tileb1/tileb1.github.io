Hey there, welcome to my website! I'm a PhD candidate in Machine Learning & Computer Vision advised by [Prof. Tinne Tuytelaars](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi/TT). Before that, I obtained my master from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) with a focus on machine learning. My primary research interests include **self-supervised** representation learning and **multi-modal** learning (vision-language).

Outside my PhD, I enjoy traveling and skiing.
